<h1>Introduction</h1>

Transport and communication are in the crucial domain in the field of analytics. 
Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the 
scientific community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing 
urban areas. These issues gain more importance due to the increasing amount of 
vehicles and people. Seeking new solutions is reaching a point where available 
technologies and artificial intelligence, especially MAS, are being recognized as ways 
to cope with and tackle these kinds of problems in a distributed and more appropriate 
way.

A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in 
flight or on a take-off or landing roll. The term is often expanded to cover other wildlife 
strikes - with bats or ground animals. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant 
threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the 
aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss 
of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has 
resulted in several fatal accidents. Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, 
but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due 
to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. This report is a detailed 
analysis on bird strikes by FAA between 2000-2011.

<h1>Purpose</h1>

● To analyze state-wise analysis of bird strikes. <br>
● To analyze the relationship between bird strikes and aircrafts. <br>
● To analyze the relationship between bird strikes and wildlife. <br>
● To study the impact of weather conditions on bird strikes. <br>
● To study yearly distribution of bird strikes and its impact on overall cost for each year. <br>
● To understand the distribution of bird strikes based on altitude. <br>
● To analyze no. of injuries due to bird strikes. <br>
● To check whether bird strikes are influenced by the pilot’s unawareness about possible wildlife/birds in the sky.
